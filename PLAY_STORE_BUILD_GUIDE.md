# Play Store Build & Submission Guide

This guide will walk you through building and submitting your Indian ETF Screener app to the Google Play Store.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Firebase setup (see FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- Google Play Console account ($25 one-time registration fee)
- EAS CLI installed globally
- All app assets ready (icons, screenshots, etc.)

## Step 1: Install EAS CLI and Login

```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to your Expo account
eas login

# If you don't have an Expo account, create one at https://expo.dev
```

## Step 2: Configure EAS Build

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/innovationm-admin/Desktop/personal-project/etfscreener/etfscreenerapp

# Initialize EAS configuration
eas build:configure
```

This will create an `eas.json` file. Update it with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 3.0.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "aab"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Update app.json with EAS Project ID

After running `eas build:configure`, you'll get a project ID. Update your `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    // ... other config
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "your-actual-project-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Prepare Firebase Configuration

1. **Add google-services.json**
   - Download from Firebase Console
   - Place in project root (same level as app.json)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Add to .gitignore to avoid committing sensitive data

2. **Update .gitignore**
   ```
   # Firebase
   google-services.json
   google-services.json.bak
   
   # Environment variables
   .env
   .env.local
   .env.production
   ```

## Step 5: Build for Production

### Option A: Build Android App Bundle (AAB) - Recommended
```bash
# Build production AAB for Play Store
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### Option B: Build APK for Testing
```bash
# Build APK for internal testing
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

## Step 6: Monitor Build Progress

- The build will run on Expo's servers
- You can monitor progress in the terminal or at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev)
- Build typically takes 10-15 minutes
- You'll get a download link when complete

## Step 7: Test Your Build

1. **Download the AAB/APK**
2. **Install on Android device**
   ```bash
   # For APK
   adb install your-app.apk
   
   # For AAB, you'll need to upload to Play Console first
   ```

3. **Test all features**:
   - App launches correctly
